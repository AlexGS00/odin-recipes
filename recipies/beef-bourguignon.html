    <p class="description">This beef bourguignon recipe made with Merlot is one of my favorites and a take-off on the venerable French dish of beef braised in Burgundy wine. Serve over mashed potatoes.</p>
    <br>
    <ul class="list">
        <li>1 (2 1/2 pound) boneless beef chuck roast, cut into 2-inch cubes</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons flour</li>
        <li>2 cups Merlot wine</li>
        <li>2 cups beef broth</li>
        <li>2 carrots, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
        <li>2 stalks celery, cut into 1/2-inch pieces</li>
        <li>4 sprigs fresh thyme</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol class="list">
        <li>Heat oil in a large Dutch oven over high heat. Cook and stir beef in hot oil until browned on all sides, 10 to 15 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to transfer meat to a plate.</li>
        <li>Cook and stir onion, butter, and a pinch of salt in drippings in the Dutch oven until onion begins to sweat. Stir in flour; cook and stir until onion starts to soften, 3 to 4 minutes. Pour in wine; bring to a simmer and cook until wine is reduced by half, about 10 minutes.</li>

        <li>Return beef and any accumulated juices to the Dutch oven. Add broth, carrots, celery, thyme sprigs, and bay leaf; season with salt. Bring to a simmer, cover the pot with a lid, and cook over low heat until meat is almost tender, about 1 hour 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the lid and continue cooking at a simmer until meat is tender and stew is thick, about 30 minutes more. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
